# AluShare

AluShare is an app which enables the user to send and receive text messages and files anonymously.
Only the receiver and the sender of a message should know which content the message had, the time the message was send and that a message was send at all.

## How AluShare works
To achieve this goal AluShare sends data using the [PeerTorPeer library](https://github.com/kit-tm/PTP).

## How to run AluShare
1. Install Android Studio
2. clone the repo
3. import the project
4. connect your android device and push the run button

Notice: Because AluShare uses a Tor binary the app will only run on devices with ARM CPUs. You won't be able to run AluShare within the emulator.
